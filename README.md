# Data Structures and Algorithms
I took Data Structures and Algorithms in my second semester of freshman year in college. This was a very enjoyable class that provided me with both fun and challenging assignments.
I was required to approach computer science in a way I had never done before. Because of the effect this class had on me, I decided to document some of my projects in this repository.

### Note: For your convenience, I removed the package specification lines normally at the top of a Java program for all the files.
