# Lampsort -  a non-recursive quicksort algorithm
In my second semester of college I took a Data Structures and Algorithms course which I loved! The last few weeks of the course consisted of sorting algorithms, and our final assignment was to implement Leslie Lamport's "Lampsort" in Java. This non-recursive version of quicksort utilizes a set to ensure the correct pairs of numbers are being sorted and no pair is ever repeated. This was one of my favorite projects I was assigned, and one of my favorite sorting algorithms.

To read about Lampsort's implementation and how it works, please go to [Bertrand Meyer's blog](https://bertrandmeyer.com/2014/12/07/lampsort/) as he wrote a wonderful explanation for this algorithm.
